Some nlp stuff.


<h4>Includes a Naive Bayes Classifier implementation using a generated dataset from my very own <a href="https://github.com/tot98git/crawler">crawler</a>. I have trained a model that predicts the news category given a news title. </h4>

<h4>Includes an implemention of word2vec. Using the respective dataset and word2vec by gensim, I have trained a model that predicts the proximity between words, among other stuff. </h4>

<h4>Includes a native bigram model builder logic. This model is trained on a simpsons dialogue dataset to predict the next word given the first one. </h4>
